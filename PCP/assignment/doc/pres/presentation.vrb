\begin{block}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ease of use makes it a powerful competitor;
\item Not as powerful as OpenMP (although it can work together with TBB);
\item Good for recursive algorithms;
\item Spawning threads has very low overhead;
\item Automatic load balancing is a plus;
\item Supports incremental parallelization;
\end{itemize}
